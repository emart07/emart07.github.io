<p> This series is about landscape drawings. The materials that I used for these images was a fine tip brush pen on sketching paper. The image on the left is inspired from a small park in east L.A. and the second drawing is based on some houses near the small park. Both images were done in the year 2020, at the beginning of COVID-19 happened. My inspiration for these drawings came from the situation that we had to stay indoors when covid 19 was hapening. The small colored boxes are a represenation of looking thru a window. </p>
